# Personal Finance Calculator

This a basic personal finance calculator I use to determine how far off I am from financial independence and retirement.

It assumes that you are regularly investing into ETFs and takes into account a conservative withdrawal rate of 3.5%. Included are notes to justify the decision making behind each of the adjustable parameters.
